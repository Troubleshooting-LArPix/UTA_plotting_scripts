To start off, the tile will parse through each uart.json file in each tile directory indexed as their respective serial number.

The uart path will be loaded as an attribute of the tile.

A method will also initialize 100 Chip objects based on the uart path's description of 
how the chip-id's and io-channels are formatted for that tile.

As this portion of the tile object becomes more advanced,
allow for a default uart path to be loaded unless specifically stated otherwise,
then load the modified uart path.
